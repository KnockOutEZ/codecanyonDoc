              XAMPP/WAMP web server. And for macOS please install MAMP. For to
              install Apache web server on your system (only applicable for
              ubuntu), run the below command: sudo apt-get install apache2 But

          <br />
          <div>
            <span>b.</span> In the case of Ubuntu your root directory will be
            “/var/www/html” and in case of XAMPP it will be "C:\xampp\htdocs"
            and for WAMP it’s "C:/wamp/www". For MAMP, the root directory is
            “/Applications/MAMP/htdocs”. Of course all directory paths can
            change depending on the version you install.
          </div>
          <br />

          <div>
            <span>c.</span> Now you have to install PHP and MySQL database only
            in case of Ubuntu. Because for the rest of the Operating systems
            XAMPP or WAMP or MAMP will do all the work for you. In Ubuntu, you
            can install LAMP stack but that is a whole different story. Please
            keep the root name, password saved somewhere for further use.
          </div>
          <br />

          <div>
            <span>d.</span> To install PHP on your system please run the below
            command: sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php But for a far more

          <br />

          <div>
            <span>e.</span> After installing PHP, you need to enable the
            mod_rewrite module. To do that please run this below command: sudo
            a2enmod rewrite && sudo systemctl restart apache2 But for a far more

          </div>

          <br />

          <div>
            <span>f.</span> Now create a folder of your desired name in the root
            directory i.e. “/var/www/html” or "C:\xampp\htdocs" or "C:/wamp/www"
            or “/Applications/MAMP/htdocs”.
          </div>

          <br />

          <div>
            <span>g.</span> Put all the folders and files (i. e. application,
            assets, system, uploads and all other files) from inside the venus
            folder into the folder created in the last step.
          </div>

          <br />

          <div>
            <span>h.</span> Please keep in mind that .htaccess file is a very
            important file. It is inside the main script file (venus folder).
            Make sure that you have that file copied and pasted properly.
          </div>

          <br />

          <div>
            <span>i.</span> Now you will need to set up a MySQL database. You
            will need to set up a database only for Ubuntu operating systems
            because on Windows or macOS, softwares like XAMPP or WAMP or MAMP
            will take care of that for you. Now to install MySQL database on
            your Ubuntu system please open a terminal and write this below code:
            sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev
            But for a far more detailed instructions please refer to this

          <br />

          <div>
            <span>j.</span> To install phpMyAdmin on your system, you will need
            to run below command on your terminal: sudo apt-get install
            phpmyadmin But for a far more detailed instructions please refer to

          <br />

          <div>
            <span>k.</span> In both cases you will be asked to set up MySQL
            database passwords for later use, so please choose something strong
            and save it for later use.
          </div>
          <br />

          <div>
            <span>l.</span> Now in your MySQL database, create a database
            according to your desired name and upload the sql file
            (database.sql) provided with the script for Ubuntu. And to do that
            you will have to login into mysql using your user name and password;
            Then you will need to run the below command: CREATEDATABASE
            &ltyourdesiredname&gt ; and then press enter. After that type exit;
            ​and that you get you out of the MySQL environment;
          </div>
          <br />

          <div>
            <span>m.</span> This time you will have to go the directory where
            the database.sql (provided with the script) file is and open a
            terminal there and run the below command: mysql-u <
            yourMySQLusername > -p < your created database name in the last step
            > < database.sql; But for far more detailed instructions please

            >; This is how you need to import the database.sql file provided
            with the script to your mysql database.
          </div>
          <br />

          <div>
            <span>n.</span> If you have decided to install phpMyAdmin instead
            described in point ‘i’, you will need to visit your phpMyAdmin on
            the browser as suggested in the given tutorial and you will see the
            newly created database there. Click on it, find Import and upload
            the database.sql provided with the script and click Go at the
            bottom. But for a far more detailed instructions please refer to

          <br />

          <div>
            <span>o.</span> Then go to application/config/database.php file to
            change your database configuration on line number 79, 80 and 81. You
            need to change database username, database password and database
            name that you had created during installation of MySQL or XAMPP or
            WAMP or MAMP.
          </div>
          <br />

          <div>
            <span>p.</span> Finally, change the entire folder permission of
            uploads to 777. To perform this action you will have to open the
            root directory of the application on a terminal. Here root directory
            suggests to the directory of the script where application,
            assets,...,uploads are on. Then you will need to run the below
            command: sudo chmod -R 777 uploads/
          </div>
          <br />

          <div>
            <span>q.</span> Now please visit ​http://localhost/ ​< folder name

            venus script.

Databases.

          <br>

          <div>
            <span>b.</span> In that page you will first create a database. Then create a user with

password) information somewhere safe for further use.

            done here. Go back to the Home page of cPanel.
          </div>
          <br>

          <div>
            <span>d.</span> This time you need to visit DATABASES ->  phpMyAdmin. It will take you to a 
different page but you will see the newly created database there. Click on it, 
find Import and upload the database.sql provided with the script and click Go 
at the bottom.

          <br>

          <div>
            <span>e.</span> Now upload all the files (i. e. application, assets, system, uploads and all other

find by visiting FILES -> File Manager or you can create a folder in that 
public_html directory of your desired name and upload all files from inside 
the venus folder into that newly created folder.

configuration on line number 79, 80 and 81. You need to change database
